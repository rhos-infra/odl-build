    # on that specific IP so overcloud nodes can run DNS requests against it
    # NOTE: when your networks (net1, net2, etc.) on the hypervisor get created as part of 'infrared virsh' command and they have
    # 'dhcp:' option specificed then this will make dhcp+dns server running on that interface/IP - then you could use this IP in the below
