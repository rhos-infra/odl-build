# NOTEs about these hybrid+sriov setups
# 1. the host (hypervisor), panther23 in this case, will _not_ have a physical nor virtual NIC configured with vlans mentioned in
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PUvecYoXV80yULXlgzgK2YKqYy63R2gKUM2KngPwC58/edit#gid=0 (i.e.: 316, 325-329)
# only the overcloud nodes (controllers, compute(sriov)) ones will have interfaces with those vlans so they can communicate with each
# other and with the VLAN's gateway (10.46.23.190 in this case)

parameter_defaults:
    # it's more of a personal preference but using UTC is the safest bet when it comes to comparing timestamps between overcloud nodes
    # and other services (on undercloud, overcloud container, external world (i.e.: laptop) etc.) when troubleshooting issues
    TimeZone: 'UTC'

    # since the control plane is mainly for controlling overcloud nodes (from undercloud machine) this IP should be one of
    # undercloud's, it's the IP of 'br-ctlplane' bridge on undercloud
    # it is br-ctlplane or whatever the name the was given as part of network definition ran as part of 'infrared virsh' provisioning (most likely for its 'net1')

    # safest bet is to use IT/lab provided DNS servers (NOTE: that is only possible if all overcloud nodes will have access to external/IT/lab network)
    # if you specify IP(s) of undercloud/hypervisor here you also have to make sure there's a DNS/bind/dnsmasq server listening
    # on that specific IP so overcloud nodes can run DNS requests against it
    # NOTE: when your networks (net1, net2, etc.) on the hypervisor get created as part of 'infrared virsh' command and they have
    # 'dhcp:' option specificed then this will make dhcp+dns server running on that interface/IP - then you could use this IP in the below
    # DnsServers param
