# reason for _not_ using name like enp6s0f0.316 is there's a problem with sysctl command
# i.e.: sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.enp6s0f0.accept_ra=2 it may fail with error complaining about
# /proc/sys.../enp6s0f0/316 directory doesn't exist
# without going into details why the above is happening it's safer to use a safe name, i.e.: vlan316

# this file is a content of /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-vlan316 on panther23
# this file should be on panther already and vlan316 interface exist
# if not then paste this file's content into panther23's ifcfg-vlan316 and run
# 'systemctl restart network' _before_ any infrared virsh (i.e.: cleanup, provision)
# steps are executed
